1. Call searchNearest function with a point in one coordinate system, but searching a table in another coordinate system.
   (Assuming chosen point and search distance are ok and would normally return results)
   = should return results with distance rounded to one decimal place in miles.
   testharness1.html

2. Call function with units of "mile"
   = should return results with "Distance" property in miles.
   testharness2.html

3. Call function with units of "meter"
   = should return results with "Distance" property in meters.
   testharness3.html

4. Call function with a point outside the bounds of the table being searched.
   = Should return no results, and not report an error.
   testharness4.html

5. Call searchNearest function with includeGeometry = true
   = should return results whose "geometry" property is not null.
   testharness5.html

6. Call searchNearest function with includeGeometry = false
   = should return results whose "geometry" property is null.
   testharness6.html

7. Call searchNearest function with includeGeometry parameter missing. 
   = Should behave as if includeGeometry = false
   testharness7.html

8. Call function with a point having x and y = "" or null.
    = Function should return an error stating that the coordinates cannot be null or blank and must be numeric.
    testharness8.html
    
9. Call function with a point having srs="" or null.
    = Function should return an error stating that coordinate projection srs cannot be null or blank.
    testharness9.html   
    
10. Call function with tableName = "" or null.
    = Function should return an error stating that the tableName is a mandatory field.
    testharness10.html

11. Call function with attributeFields = "" or null.
    = Function should return values with all attributes (the default)
    testharness11.html     
    
12. Call searchNearest function with includeGeometry = "" or null
   = Should behave as if includeGeometry = false, i.e. no geometries returned.
   testharness12.html

13. Call function with maxResults = "" or null.
    = Function should return an error stating that the maxResults is a mandatory field.
    testharness13.html 

14. Call function with maxDistance = ""
    = Function should return results.
    testharness14.html    
    
15. Call function with maxDistance = null
    = Function should return results.
    testharness14.html         
    
16. Call function with null or blank distanceUnit paramater.
    = Function should return one or more results with the distanceUnit should default to "mile".
    testharness15.html 

17. Call function with tableName parameter missing.
    = Function should return an error stating that the tableName is a mandatory field.
    testharness16.html   

18. Call function with maxResults parameter missing.
    = Function should return an error stating that the maxResults is a mandatory field.
    testharness17.html   

19. Call function with maxDistance parameter missing.
    = Function should return one or more results.
    testharness18.html 

20. Call function with tableName parameter incorrect.
    = Function should return return a specific error stating that the the table name was not recognised.
    testharness19.html


FIXME 11 and 17, 14 and 18, and 15 and 19 should be merged into one page 
respectively or split into three speparate ones (no param, null, empty string)
