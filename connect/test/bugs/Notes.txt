The tests described here are not all used in the suite. 

There needs to be some rationalisation of which tests are appropriate for the Connect app, which ones should be tested on the core code & which should be on the RIA Controls themselves.

Only after that rationalisation of the test purposes will the modifications be made to include the tests in the appropriate place in the SVN structure & point to the appropriate .xml configuration file.

Scripts for CONN-1355 and CONN-1367 currently do not adequately test the scenarios for the bugs, and should not be run at this time - the scripts have been committed in case fixes can be established.
