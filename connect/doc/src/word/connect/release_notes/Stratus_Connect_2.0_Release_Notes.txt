Stratus™ Connect 2.0
Release Notes

About Stratus Connect
---------------------
Stratus Connect enables you to add mapping and geocoding capabilities to your website. With Stratus Connect, you can place maps on your Web site that display your business data. Stratus Connect makes use of the Stratus RIA Controls. They allow you to rapidly build Web-mapping applications that are easy to use for end users. The maps are fully embeddable, scriptable and skinnable using JavaScript. 

Specifications
---------------------
* The caching for maps and configuration files has been set to 60 minutes. After this period, the files expire from the cache and will be refreshed on reload.
* The caching for images in the Legend has been set to one minute. After this period, the images will expire from the client cache and will be refreshed on reload.
* Stratus Connect can be internationalised. This includes tool tips and the user interface. Texts defined in configuration files, for example map names, must be localised in the configuration file itself. All data, for example map data, is displayed as is.

Configuring Connect
---------------------
* You can speed up the rendering of images in IE6 if you choose to use GIF transparency. IE6 does not fully support the normal PNG transparency, but it does support GIF transparency. You configure the use of the IE6 GIF transparency fix in the Administration Console on Map Configs > Settings. Select the Enable GIF Support option. To be able to use the GIF transparency fix, you must also clear the Alpha Channel option on Map Configs > Maps.
